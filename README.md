### CICERO 0.1.8

CICERO (Clipped-reads Extended for RNA Optimization) is an assembly-based algorithm to detect diverse classes
of driver gene fusions from RNA-seq.

Invoke the CICERO wrapper as
```
Cicero.sh [-n ncores] -b bamfile -g genome -r refdir [-j junctions]
```

Where `ncores` is the number of cores to be run on (with [GNU parallel](https://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/),
`bamfile` is the input bamfile, `genome` is GRCh37-lite, `refdir` is the reference file directory specific to
CICERO, and `junctions` is the (optional) junctions file output from RNApeg.

Once you have the output from CICERO, use the following [guide](https://www.stjude.cloud/docs/guides/tools/rapid-rnaseq/) to interpret the results.

### Generate junctions file with RNApeg

RNApeg is required to generate a junctions file for use by CICERO. You can get RNApeg from both Docker and Singularity.

Running RNApeg via Docker:
```
docker run mnedmonson/public:rnapeg RNApeg.sh -b bamfile -f fasta -r refflat [-rg refflat]
```
Running RNApeg via Singularity:
```
singularity run docker://mnedmonson/public:rnapeg RNApeg.sh -b bamfile -f fasta -r refflat [-rg refflat]
```

### Downloading reference files

Reference files are required to run CICERO. They can be found at the following location:
