CICERO (Clipped-reads Extended for RNA Optimization) is an assembly-based algorithm to detect diverse classes
of driver gene fusions from RNA-seq.

## Running CICERO <a name="running"></a>
Add the `src/scripts` directory to your system `PATH` variable. Add the `src/perllib` and `dependencies/lib/perl` directories to your system `PERL5LIB` variable. 

Then invoke the CICERO wrapper as
```
Cicero.sh [-n ncores] -b bamfile -g genome -r refdir -o outdir [-j junctions] [-t threshold] [-s sc_cutoff] [-c sc_shift] [-p]
```

- `ncores` is the number of cores to be run on (with [GNU parallel](https://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/)).
- `bamfile` is the input bamfile mapped to human genome builds GRCh37-lite or GRCh38_no_alt. [Contact us](mailto:liqing.tian@stjude.org) if your bam is based on other reference version.
- `genome` is either `GRCh37-lite` or `GRCh38_no_alt`. CICERO only support the two human reference genome versions.
- `refdir` is the reference file directory specific to CICERO. See [Reference Files](#reference) below.
- `junctions` is the junctions file output from RNApeg. See [Generate Junctions](#junctions) below. CICERO can detect fusion by analysis of splice junction reads. If this option is omitted, fusions generated by small deletions may be missed as these events may lack the soft-clipped reads.

The final CICERO fusion result file will be located at `<outdir>/CICERO_DATADIR/<sample name>/final_fusions.txt`. Use the following [guide](https://www.stjude.cloud/docs/guides/genomics-platform/analyzing-data/rapid-rnaseq/) to interpret the results.

To visualize CICERO fusion output you can load the final fusion output file at https://proteinpaint.stjude.org/FusionEditor/.

## Running with Docker <a name="docker"></a>

CICERO can be run with Docker. To begin, build the Docker image using the Dockerfile in this repository. 

```
docker build -t stjude/cicero:0.2.0 .
```

Then invoke the CICERO wrapper using Docker.

```
docker run -v <path to reference directory>:/reference stjude/cicero:0.2.0 Cicero.sh [-n cores] -b <bam file path> -g <genome, e.g. GRCh37-lite> -r /reference -o <output directory> [-j junctions file] [-p] [-s int] [-t int] [-c int]
```

## Running with St. Jude Cloud <a name="cloud"></a>

CICERO is integrated in the St. Jude Cloud Rapid RNA-Seq workflow. To run CICERO in St. Jude Cloud, access the tool through the [platform page](https://platform.stjude.cloud/workflows/rapid_rna-seq). Documentation
for running and interpreting results is available in the [user guide](https://stjudecloud.github.io/docs/guides/genomics-platform/analyzing-data/rapid-rnaseq/).

## Generate junctions file with RNApeg <a name="junctions"></a>

RNApeg is required to generate a junctions file for use by CICERO. You can get RNApeg from both Docker and Singularity. Once RNApeg is complete, the `*.junctions.tab.shifted.tab` file can be provided to CICERO using the `-j` argument. 

### Running RNApeg via Docker:
```
docker run -v <outdir>:/results mnedmonson/public:rnapeg RNApeg.sh -b bamfile -f fasta -r refflat
```
### Running RNApeg via Singularity:
```
singularity run --bind <outdir>:/results docker://mnedmonson/public:rnapeg RNApeg.sh -b bamfile -f fasta -r refflat
```

## Downloading reference files <a name="reference"></a>

Reference files are required to run CICERO. They can be found at the following location:
* GRCh37-lite: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3817656
* GRCh38_no_alt: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3894739

## Supported Genome Version <a name="genomes"></a>

CICERO currently supports `GRCh37-lite` and `GRCh38_no_alt`. 

## Demo <a name="demo"></a>

A demo of CICERO can be found at the following location:
