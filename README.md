# CICERO 0.2.0

CICERO (Clipped-reads Extended for RNA Optimization) is an assembly-based algorithm to detect diverse classes
of driver gene fusions from RNA-seq.

## Running CICERO <a name="running"></a>

Invoke the CICERO wrapper as
```
Cicero.sh [-n ncores] -b bamfile -g genome -r refdir [-j junctions] [-o outdir] [-t threshold] [-s sc_cutoff] [-c sc_shift] [-p]
```

Where `ncores` is the number of cores to be run on (with [GNU parallel](https://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/)),
`bamfile` is the input bamfile, `genome` is GRCh37-lite, `refdir` is the reference file directory specific to
CICERO, and `junctions` is the (optional) junctions file output from RNApeg.

Once you have the output from CICERO, use the following [guide](https://www.stjude.cloud/docs/guides/tools/rapid-rnaseq/) to interpret the results.

## Running with Docker <a name="docker"></a>

CICERO can be run with Docker. To begin, build the Docker image using the Dockerfile in this repository. 

```
docker build -t stjude/cicero:0.2.0 .
```

Then invoke the CICERO wrapper using Docker.

```
docker run -v reference:/reference stjude/cicero:0.2.0 [-n cores] -b <bam file path> -g <genome, e.g. GRCh37-lite> -r /reference [-j junctions file] [-o output directory] [-p] [-s int] [-t int] [-c int]
```

## Generate junctions file with RNApeg <a name="junctions"></a>

RNApeg is required to generate a junctions file for use by CICERO. You can get RNApeg from both Docker and Singularity.

Running RNApeg via Docker:
```
docker run mnedmonson/public:rnapeg RNApeg.sh -b bamfile -f fasta -r refflat [-rg refflat]
```
Running RNApeg via Singularity:
```
singularity run docker://mnedmonson/public:rnapeg RNApeg.sh -b bamfile -f fasta -r refflat [-rg refflat]
```

## Downloading reference files <a name="reference"></a>

Reference files are required to run CICERO. They can be found at the following location:
* https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3817656

## Genome Version <a name="dependencies"></a>

CICERO currently only supports `GRCh37-lite`. We are working towards support for `GRCh38` in the future. 

## Demo <a name="demo"></a>

A demo of CICERO can be found at the following location:
